## Dataset

The dataset used for the Wine Quality Prediction project contains information about various physicochemical properties of wines and their corresponding quality ratings. These properties are often used to assess and predict the quality of wines.



## Model

Several machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the quality of wine. Here, I have used Linear Regression.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted. 
5. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
6. Train the model: Utilize an algorithm such as Linear Regression to build a model .
7. Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as precision, confusion matrix, and acurracy to assess the model's performance.
8. Make predictions: Deploy the trained model to make predictions.

Update the main script and documentation accordingly, incorporating any changes made during the development process.


## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
